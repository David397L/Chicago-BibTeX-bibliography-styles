# Chicago-BibTeX-bibliography-styles

chicago18ad.bst is a BibTeX bibliography style for the Chicago author-date (eighteenth edition) citation style.

The initial development goal is for the file to match as closely as possible the description of the style given at 
https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html

This is the most recent (2024) edition of the Chicago manual of style.

If you use this file, please consider giving me a star if you liked the results, or let me know if you didn't. If you would like to develop anything further, please make a pull request.

Happy BibTeXing!
